          BitPay.Creditcard looks at what happens when you “spend Bitcoin with a card”: how balances are converted, which rails
          move the money, and where fees, spreads and tax questions show up in the process.

    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Bitcoin or Crypto Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A Bitcoin or crypto card is a regular network card (Visa, Mastercard or similar) that draws value from a
        connected wallet or exchange account. At checkout the merchant is still paid in fiat; the crypto balance is
        converted behind the scenes to fund that payment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most products therefore behave like a prepaid or debit card layered on top of a trading account. Your on-chain
        holdings are not pushed directly across the card network. Instead, a service provider sells a slice of your
        crypto and uses traditional card rails to settle the transaction.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How a BitPay-Style Transaction Flows</h2>
      <p>
        When you tap or insert the card, the terminal sends an authorisation request through the usual card network.
        The processor checks your linked wallet or account, verifies that sufficient value is available, and either
        converts crypto immediately or reserves an amount for later batch conversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In real-time conversion models, a quote is taken from the provider’s order book at or near the moment of
        purchase. In preload models, you first top up a fiat balance from your crypto holdings, and the card then behaves
        like any other balance-funded card until that load is exhausted.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Spreads, Fees and Effective Exchange Rates</h2>
      <p>
        Crypto card marketing often highlights “no extra fees”, but the real cost of using Bitcoin or other assets at
        checkout usually sits in the spread between the quoted rate and the mid-market rate, plus any network and
        service fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the true cost, you need to look at three layers together: conversion spread, foreign transaction
        fees (if you pay in another currency) and any flat or percentage charges on ATM withdrawals or top-ups. A small
        percentage at each stage can add up quickly, especially on frequent, smaller purchases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rewards and Incentives on Crypto-Linked Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Some Bitcoin and crypto cards pay rewards in native tokens, stablecoins or standard card rewards. The headline
        rate can look generous, but it needs to be weighed against spreads, volatility and any lock-up or staking
        requirements attached to the programme.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also worth checking whether rewards are paid on all transactions or only on particular categories, and how
        they are treated when you refund purchases or move assets off the platform. Terms can differ significantly
        between providers, even if the branding looks similar.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Volatility and Tax Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        For many jurisdictions, converting crypto to fiat is treated as a disposal for tax purposes. Using a Bitcoin
        card for everyday purchases can therefore generate a long trail of small taxable events, each with its own
        acquisition price and disposal value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volatility adds another layer of complexity: your card balance in fiat terms can move sharply between the moment
        you decide to hold assets for spending and the moment you actually pay. Good record-keeping and exportable
        transaction histories are important if you plan to use a crypto card regularly.
